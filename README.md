# üê¶ Ubird

Welcome to **Ubird**, a simple birding app for birders everywhere!

Whether you're just starting out or are an experienced birder looking for another place to store your bird data, Ubird has you covered.

Keep track of birds you want to encounter or have encountered. If you want, you can also leave ratings for each attempt or sighting!

Yes, the *Uber* pun is not unintentional; much like the ridesharing app, you're also able to give ratings to your encounters, whether because you enjoyed the encounter or not, or whether the location was ideal or not, let other users know how you really felt about it.

## üöÄ Getting Started

The site can be accessed [here](https://birding-app-09a085f60a2e.herokuapp.com/).

### üìù Instructions:

1. Click on **Sign Up** to create an account if you don't already have one. 
2. Click on **Sign In** once you have an account to login to the website.
3. Click on **My Profile** to see your personal profile.
4. Click on **Add New Bird** and then fill out a form to log a bird sighting or attempt to your list. Leave ratings or comments if desired.
5. Click on **Add New Bird** *button* under the form, and the bird is now on your list! Feel free to edit any data on the bird that you wish, or delete it altogether!

> Be sure to check out **The Flock**, the database of all the users in our community, and see the birds they've seen or attempted to see. Find out which locations are best or what variety of birds exist in an area. Also be sure to check out **Our Birds** for a database of birds and the encounters or attempts our users have had with them.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

AI was used for the purposes of some debugging assistance and help with image creation, as well as some style choices, but the overall design and development was done by me.

## üîú Next Steps

* The next step would be to make the website more interactive. Users are able to see other users' birds and can read about them, but I would consider adding some features which allow for more collaboration and exchange of ideas, such as comment sections.

* Another possible next step is to create a page to allow users to sort by location, maybe integrating a map API that would allow users to pinpoint their encounters on maps, which would allow other users to see the best locations for various birds.

* More responsive design for smaller screens or windows.
